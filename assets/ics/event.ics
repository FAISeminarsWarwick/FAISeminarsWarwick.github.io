DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Volkan Cevher\nDate: 2024-04-26\nLocation: Mathematical Sciences Building\, MB0.07\, University of Warwick\, Coventry\, UK\nAbstract\nOne prominent approach toward resolving the adversarial vulnerability of deep neural networks is the two-player zero-sum paradigm of adversarial training\, in which predictors are trained against adversarially-chosen perturbations of data. Despite the promise of this approach\, algorithms based on this paradigm have not engendered sufficient levels of robustness and suffer from pathological behavior like robust overfitting.\nTo understand this shortcoming\, we first show that the commonly used surrogate-based relaxation used in adversarial training algorithms voids all guarantees on the robustness of trained classifiers. The identification of this pitfall informs a novel non-zero-sum bilevel formulation of adversarial training\, wherein each player optimizes a different objective function.\nOur formulation naturally yields a simple algorithmic framework that matches and in some cases outperforms state-of-the-art attacks\, attains comparable levels of robustness to standard adversarial training algorithms\, and does not suffer from robust overfitting.\n________________________________\nAbout Volkan Cevher\nVolkan Cevher received the B.Sc.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jiaxin Shi (Deepmind)\nDate: 24-05-2024, 2pm-3pm (BST)\nLocation: Mathematical Sciences Building, MB0.07, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK\n\nAbstract\nI will give an overview of our recent work that connects two major directions in unsupervised learning—spectral methods and generative models. Historically, these two classes of methods are often considered separately. In this talk, I will show that it is possible to connect them through a spectral representation of the data distribution gradients. This motivates several promising ideas for unsupervised learning, including score-based modelling and self-supervised learning with eigenfunctions. I will discuss the statistical principles behind these developments such as Stein’s method, and how we can leverage them to extend such methods to challenging domains with discrete structures and other constraints.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Arthur Gretton (Gatsby, UCL)\nDate: 05-06-2024, 2pm-3pm (BST)\nLocation: Zeeman Building, Mainsite, MS0.05, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK\n\nAbstract\nA fundamental causal modelling task is to predict the effect of an intervention (or treatment) on an outcome, given context/covariates. Examples include predicting the effect of a medical treatment on patient health given patient symptoms and demographic information, or predicting the effect of ticket pricing on airline sales given seasonal fluctuations in demand. The problem becomes especially challenging when the treatment and context are complex (for instance, "treatment" might be a web ad design or a radiotherapy plan), and when only observational data is available (i.e., we have access to historical data, but cannot intervene ourselves). The challenge is greater still when the covariates are not observed, and constitute a hidden source of confounding.\n\nI will give an overview of some practical tools and methods for estimating causal effects of complex, high dimensional treatments from observational data. The approach is based on conditional feature means, which represent conditional expectations of relevant model features. These features can be deep neural nets (adaptive, finite dimensional, learned from data), or kernel features (fixed, infinite dimensional, enforcing smoothness). When hidden confounding is present, a neural net implementation of instrumental variable regression can be used to correct for this confounding. The methods will be applied to modelling employment outcomes for the US Job Corps program for Disadvantaged Youth, and in policy evaluation for reinforcement learning.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Francis Bach \nDate: 18-06-2024, 11am-12pm (BST)\nLocation: Mathematical Sciences Building, MB0.07, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK\n\nAbstract\nA Physics-informed machine learning combines the expressiveness of data-based approaches with the interpretability of physical models. In this context, we consider a general regression problem where the empirical risk is regularized by a partial differential equation that quantifies the physical inconsistency. We prove that for linear differential priors, the problem can be formulated as a kernel regression task. Taking advantage of kernel theory, we derive convergence rates for the minimizer of the regularized risk and show that it converges at least at the Sobolev minimax rate. However, faster rates can be achieved, depending on the physical error.
