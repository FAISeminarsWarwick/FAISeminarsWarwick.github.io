DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Volkan Cevher\nDate: 2024-04-26\nLocation: Mathematica
 l Sciences Building\, MB0.07\, University of Warwick\, Coventry\, UK\nAbst
 ract\nOne prominent approach toward resolving the adversarial vulnerabilit
 y of deep neural networks is the two-player zero-sum paradigm of adversari
 al training\, in which predictors are trained against adversarially-chosen
  perturbations of data. Despite the promise of this approach\, algorithms 
 based on this paradigm have not engendered sufficient levels of robustness
  and suffer from pathological behavior like robust overfitting.\nTo unders
 tand this shortcoming\, we first show that the commonly used surrogate-bas
 ed relaxation used in adversarial training algorithms voids all guarantees
  on the robustness of trained classifiers. The identification of this pitf
 all informs a novel non-zero-sum bilevel formulation of adversarial traini
 ng\, wherein each player optimizes a different objective function.\nOur fo
 rmulation naturally yields a simple algorithmic framework that matches and
  in some cases outperforms state-of-the-art attacks\, attains comparable l
 evels of robustness to standard adversarial training algorithms\, and does
  not suffer from robust overfitting.\n________________________________\nAb
