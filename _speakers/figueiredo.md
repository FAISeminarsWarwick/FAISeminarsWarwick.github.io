## Abstract

Most statistical learning and inference methods, from standard and
variational Bayesian inference to empirical risk minimization, can be
unified through a variational perspective that seeks a trade-off
between empirical risk and prior knowledge. In this talk, I will
describe a new, recently introduced general class of variational
methods based on Fenchel-Young (FY) losses that extends and
encompasses Bayesian principles. This approach, based on Fenchel
conjugation (a central tool of convex analysis), generalizes the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and encompasses Bayesian as well as
classical variational learning. Furthermore, this framework provides
generalized notions of free energy, evidence, evidence lower bound,
and posterior, while still enabling standard optimization techniques
such as alternating minimization and gradient backpropagation,
allowing to learn broader class of models than previous variational
formulations.
