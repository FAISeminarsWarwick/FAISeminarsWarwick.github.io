## Abstract

In this talk I will discuss recent progress in learning multi-index functions - a rich class of functions including two-layer neural networks, and which have recent gained in popularity as a model for supervised learning data where the labels only depend on a low dimensional manifold of the covariates. First, I will discuss how much data two-layer neural networks need to learn a multi-index target. Second, I will discuss the fundamental computational bottlenecks in this problem.

### About [Bruno Loureiro](https://brloureiro.github.io)

Dr. Bruno Loureiro is a CNRS researcher based at the Centre for Data Science at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris working on the crossroads between machine learning and statistical mechanics. I also hold an Adjunct professor (“Professeur Attaché”) position at the Université Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) where I teach at the undergraduate and graduate programs of the affiliated universities. Before moving to CNRS & ENS, he was a postdoc at the Institut de Physique Théorique (IPhT) in Paris and at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, working with Lenka Zdeborová and Florent Krzakala. Before his postdoc, he read the part III of the Mathematics Tripos at the University of Cambridge, and continued into a PhD at the TCM group in the same university.
