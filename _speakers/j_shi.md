# Spectral Methods and Generative Modeling: A Unifying Perspective

## Abstract

I will give an overview of our recent work that connects two major directions in unsupervised learningâ€”spectral methods and generative models. Historically, these two classes of methods are often considered separately. In this talk, I will show that it is possible to connect them through a spectral
representation of the data distribution gradients. This motivates several promising ideas for unsupervised learning, including score-based modelling and self-supervised learning with eigenfunctions. I will discuss the statistical principles behind these developments such as Stein's method, and how we can leverage them to extend such methods to challenging domains with discrete structures and other constraints.
