# Theoretical Foundations Of Self Consuming Generative Models

## Abstract

The rapid progress in generative models has resulted in impressive leaps in generation quality, blurring the lines between synthetic and real data. Web-scale datasets are now prone to the inevitable contamination by synthetic data, directly impacting the training of future generated models. In this talk, I will start from the very beginnings on generative models that are trained on their data and prove the conditions for model collapse or stable iterative retraining depending on the fraction of generated data used at each retraining step. In addition, I will marry theory to current practice of iterative retraining after a human in the loop data curation step. For instance, many interfaces of popular text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, produce several variations of an image for a given query which can eventually be curated by the users. I will then overview a series of theoretical results that the data curation on iterated retraining of generative models can be seen as an implicit preference optimization mechanism. Finally, I will outline illustrative experiments on both synthetic datasets and on CIFAR10 showing that such a procedure amplifies biases of the reward model.
