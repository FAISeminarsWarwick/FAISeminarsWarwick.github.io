# Learning Dynamics in Multiplayer Games

## Abstract

Intelligence frequently evolves through interaction and competition. In a similar vein, advanced AI algorithms often depend on competing learning objectives. Whether through data sampling, environmental interactions, or self-play methods, agents continuously refine their strategies to reach an equilibrium—a state where competing objectives are balanced. This talk delves into the learning dynamics within multi-player games, where players adapt their strategies to achieve equilibrium. We will explore how these equilibrium-seeking dynamics differ from single-player optimization, tackling key challenges such as rotational dynamics, noise, and constraints. The discussion will draw on examples from machine learning, including robust objectives, generative adversarial networks, and multi-agent reinforcement learning, emphasizing the significance of learning dynamics in these areas.

### About [Tatjana Chavdarova](https://chavdarova.github.io/)

Tatjana Chavdarova is a visiting professor in the Department of Electronics, Information, and Bioengineering (DEIB) at Politecnico di Milano (Polimi), where she collaborates with Nicola Gatti and Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi. Her research lies at the intersection of game theory and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on optimization and algorithmic innovation. She holds a Ph.D. in machine learning from EPFL and Idiap, where she was supervised by François Fleuret. During her doctoral studies, she completed internships at Mila, working with Yoshua Bengio and Simon Lacoste-Julien, and at DeepMind, under the mentorship of Irina Jurenka (formerly Higgins). Following her Ph.D., Tatjana served as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at EPFL’s Machine Learning and Optimization (MLO) lab with Martin Jaggi, and later joined UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) as a Postdoctoral Researcher working with Michael I. Jordan. Her research has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation through the Early.Postdoc.Mobility and Postdoc.Mobility fellowships.
