## Abstract

My work focuses on solving multi-objective optimization problems in the context of resource allocation problems, where societal considerations such as fairness or incentives are at play. In this talk, I will focus on a particular study of treatment estimation under competition, published at ICML’24. In many applications of randomized controlled trials, users are subject to multiple experiments at the same time (e.g. seeing multiple ads on online platforms). For an experimenter, estimating a causal effect becomes difficult under competition from other experiments, as the position at which a user sees a treatment influences their response. In this paper, we build a game-theoretic model of agents who wish to estimate causal effects in the presence of competition, through a bidding system and a utility function that minimizes estimation error. Our main technical result establishes an approximation with a tractable objective that maximizes the sample value obtained through strategically allocating budget on subjects. This allows us to find an equilibrium in our model under broad conditions. Conceptually, our work combines elements from causal inference and game theory to shed light on the equilibrium behavior of experimentation under competition. This is joint work with Vivian Y. Nastl and Moritz Hardt.
