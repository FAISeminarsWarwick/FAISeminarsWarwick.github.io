## Abstract

Deep neural networks excel in high-dimensional problems, often surpassing models such as kernel methods, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, the theoretical foundations of their success remain poorly understood. We propose that the compositional sparsity of the target function is the key factor determining when deep networks outperform other approaches. Taking a step toward formalizing this idea, we consider a simple sparse compositional model, namely the multi-index model. In this context, we introduce and study hyper-kernel ridge regression (HKRR), an approach blending neural networks and  kernel methods. Our main contribution is  sample complexity results demonstrating that HKRR can efficiently learn in settings where classical kernel methods fail, thus overcoming the curse of dimensionality. These theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments.
