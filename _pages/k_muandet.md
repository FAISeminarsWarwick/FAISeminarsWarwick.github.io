## Abstract

The expectation operation is a cornerstone of both statistics and machine learning. It provides a fundamental principle for understanding and developing algorithms, especially those that involve probabilistic models, randomized processes, and the optimization of objective functions expressed as sums of expected values. However, the evolving landscape of machine learning applications increasingly demands capabilities beyond traditional linear expectations. In this talk, I will explore the benefits of going beyond linear expectations in machine learning. First, I’ll present Kernel Quantile Embedding (KQE), a Hilbert space representation of distributions that extend beyond the standard Kernel Mean Embedding (KME). The KQE gives rise to a family of distances that: (i) are probability metrics under weaker kernel conditions than Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD); (ii) recover a kernelised form of the sliced Wasserstein distance; and (iii) can be efficiently estimated with near-linear cost. Then, I’ll present the Integral Imprecise Probability Metric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical Integral Probability Metrics (IPMs) to the setting of capacities, a broad class of imprecise probability (IP) models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities, probability intervals, belief functions, and more.
