## Abstract

In this talk, I will (briefly) talk about the history of Imprecise Probabilities (IPs), from their inception in Philosophy, to their later adoption in Statistics and other sciences. After that, I'll make the case for why IPs are useful and indeed needed in (Probabilistic) Machine Learning methodology and theory. I will conclude with a recent result in Imprecise Probabilistic Machine Learning methodology concerning the use of sets of distributions to improve Conformal Prediction Regions for classification problems with ambiguous ground truth. The effectiveness of the results is testified by an application to a dermatology dataset.
